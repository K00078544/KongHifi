                <h3><span class="articleTitle">Ibibio Sound Machine - Uyai</span></h3>
                <h4><span class="review">2017, Afro-Pop</span></h4>
                <h4><span class="review">Kong Hi-fi Rating  <span class="fa fa-star"></span></span></h4>
                <h4><span class="authorDate">Paul Simpson 1/3/17</span></h4>
                <p>Following the warm reception of Ibibio Sound Machine's 2014 self-titled debut, the London-based collective unexpectedly signed to American indie rock powerhouse Merge Records for the release of sophomore album Uyai in 2017. With this release, the eight-member group continues its blend of West African rhythms, disco, funk, and electro, adding a bit more post-punk and new wave this time around. Dynamic frontwoman Eno Williams is still the star of the show, and while many of her lyrics (sung in Ibibio and English) are still based on Nigerian folktales.</p>
                <p>This album is more socially conscious, reflecting on recent events and the general state of the world. Opening song "Give Me a Reason," an ecstatic highlife/electroclash crossover, is about the abduction of 276 female students in Chibok, Nigeria in 2014. Dealing with such heavy topics, the album has a slightly darker edge, but it's still incredibly playful and celebratory. This is hopeful, all-inclusive music that calls out for the liberation of women and Africans, as well as freedom for the human race in general. Most of the songs are party jams, combining '80s R and B/funk melodies, shuffling drums, blazing guitars, and fiery horns with strong vocals and playful synths. "Joy (Idaresit)" has distorted post-punk bass guitar along with complex drumming and swirling echo effects. "Power of 3" brings the live drumming and bass guitar to the forefront, but is still adorned with spacy disco effects. "Trance Dance," all the way at the end of the album, is absolutely frantic, with ultra-busy drumming and giddy vocals.</p>
                <p>The album does cool down on a few occasions, however. The loose, airy "Quiet" and electro-tinged "Lullaby" are both self-explanatory, and the soft, sighing "Cry (Eyed)" is also appropriately sad and bittersweet. Uyai is a fine, boundary-pushing follow-up to an arresting debut.</p>

                <h3><span class="articleTitle">Lusine - Sensorimotor</span></h3>
                <h4><span class="review">2017, Ambient Techno</span></h4>
                <h4><span class="review">Kong Hi-fi Rating  <span class="fa fa-star"></span></span></h4>
                <h4><span class="authorDate">Timothy Monger 1/3/17</span></h4>
                <p>After a pair of albums that leaned more heavily on pop melodicism, Seattle-based electronic auteur Lusine edges gently back toward the cloudy fringe with Sensorimotor, his fourth full-length for Ghostly International. Jeff McIlwain's output as Lusine has been difficult to pigeonhole over the course of nearly two decades, veering from tuneful yet fractured electropop to shadowy textural experimentations and building his own little ecosystems along the way.</p>
                <p>Inspired in part by the title's literal meaning, Sensorimotor takes a binary approach, pairing the lushness of the senses with the functional actions of movement. In a sense, this has been a recurring theme for McIlwain's music over the years in the way that he toys with sensory aesthetics over an often minimalistic framework of rhythm. The album opens with "Canopy," a slow-building manipulation of chimes that dances celestially across the stereo field before devolving into a disorienting three-chord rhythmic pulse. Having introduced the tone, he switches gear to a more familiar style with "Ticking Hands," a pensive musing on apartness featuring vocals from his wife and frequent collaborator, Sarah McIlwain. This song, like the other guest-assisted vocal tracks, more resembles the fragmented EDM pop singles of latter-day Lusine releases like A Certain Distance and Waiting Room. While not McIlwain's most immediately accessible piece, the Benoît Pioulard-sung "Witness" deftly shape-shifts two-thirds of the way through, delivering a magnificently unnatural vocal arpeggiation whose artifice literally leaves you breathless. Of the instrumental tracks, the percolating synths of "The Level" are augmented by misty field recordings while the brief but entrancing "Chatter" feels like broken field recordings augmented by occasional synths. The growling ambient "Tropopause" feels like a sister track to the more gentle opener while the epic seven-minute closer, "The Lift," wields the most raw power and density of the bunch.</p>
                <p>With Sensorimotor, Lusine takes another evolutionary step forward, seeming strangely natural in his skin of manipulation.</p>

                <h3><span class="articleTitle">Kneebody - Anti-Hero</span></h3>
                <h4><span class="review">2017, Jazz/Funk</span></h4>
                <h4><span class="review">Kong Hi-fi Rating  <span class="fa fa-star"></span></span></h4>
                <h4><span class="authorDate">Matt Collar 1/3/17</span></h4>
                <p>Mixing jazz, funk, and electric and electronic sounds with improvisation and intricately crafted group interplay, Kneebody make a basically uncategorizable brand of exploratory jazz and rock. Post-jazz? That said, the bandmembers, who originally met at Eastman in the '90s and now split their time between Los Angeles and New York, are less traditional musicians than they are instrumental shapers of space, mapmakers charting the topographical landscape of their collective musical mind's eye.</p> 
                <p>Making up that collective eye on 2017's Anti-Hero are tenor saxophonist Ben Wendel, trumpeter Shane Endsley, keyboardist Adam Benjamin, bassist Kaveh Rastegar, and drummer Nate Wood. Although they've all spiderwebbed their talents outward, establishing themselves as in-demand talents on the progressive jazz and improvisational music scene, it is with Kneebody that they are perhaps best recognized. Anti-Hero follows up their 2015 effort, Kneedelus, an expansive collaboration with electronic musician Daedelus. While Anti-Hero technically lacks Daedelus' spacy, acid-drenched electronics, it still feels deeply informed by that experience. Here, Kneebody take their standard jazz quintet instrumentation and accent it with various synths and electronic pedal effects applied to their horns and voices. Cuts like "Uprising," with its distorted, bass-heavy riff, and the propulsive, electronic dance music-informed "Drum Battle" have a hallucinatory, drug-like quality with sections that move from tightly wound interlocking riffs to spiraling, dream-state improvisations. Similarly, tracks like the menacingly determined "The Balloonist" and the soupy, sludge-laden "Carry On" work as a showcase for both Kneebody's deft arranging skills and their own distinctive, post-bop-informed solos. What's particularly pleasing about Kneebody's sound on Anti-Hero is the balance they achieve between tangible acoustic instrumentation and the more alien sounds. Listen to how the jaunty, hip-hop-inflected intro to "Drum Battle" gives way to the computer-like fractals of Benjamin's synth and Wood's kinetic EDM-style beat. Elsewhere, cuts like the opening "For the Fallen," the sparkling "Profar," and the languid, kaleidoscopic "Mikie Lee" have an organic symmetry that brings to mind a jam band take on the cyclical compositions of Steve Reich.</p>
                <p>As the title implies, Kneebody's Anti-Hero is an engaging album of instrumental jazz that achieves its goals while stridently defying convention.</p>

                <h3><span class="articleTitle">Alasdair Roberts - Pangs</span></h3>
                <h4><span class="review">2017, Indie/Folk</span></h4>
                <h4><span class="review">Kong Hi-fi Rating  <span class="fa fa-star"></span></span></h4>
                <h4><span class="authorDate">Timothy Monger 25/2/17</span></h4>
                <p>Edging fringeward from the acoustic minimalism of his excellent 2015 self-titled LP, Scottish folk auteur Alasdair Roberts and his nimble rhythm section meander through ten new explorations of the fresh and the ancient.</p> 
                <p>Recorded in a converted mill in Northern Ireland by Julie McLarnon, Pangs is quintessential Roberts, melding centuries-old Anglo musicality with his distinctive quasi-mystical sensibilities that consistently distance him so far from the mainstream as to remain timeless. Nine albums into his career, he's pulled off the tough trick of staying anomalous while adhering to what is basically his take on traditional folk music of the British Isles. Take, for example "An Altar in the Glade," an agile two-parter in which the narrator chases a startled deer into a wooded altar then muses darkly on the assortment of creatures (crow, vermin, herring gull) going about their day's tasks. Roberts' twin acoustic and electric guitars stutter in warm cascades while bassist Stevie Jones and drummer Alex Neilson gamely follow suit, soon transitioning into a lively Renaissance-inspired refrain punctuated by a pair of spirited dog barks. An odd bird with a career to match, Roberts' flights of fancy may not resonate with the average listener, but the world he's authored over his nearly two decades of work is a truly unique genre and of it he is the undisputed master. "The Downward Road," replete with burbling synths, skittering drums, fiddle, and group vocals, offers another strange trip, while "The Angry Laughing God" delivers a rousing mash-up of early rock rhythms, bright folk-pop, and rapid Brian Wilson-esque changes. Melodious folk ballad "Scarce of Fishing" is one the album's loveliest, proving that Roberts can still dial in his eccentricities to deliver something more straightforwardly pleasing. </p>
                <p>Peculiar and ultimately charming, Pangs is another high caliber entry in Roberts' dependably creative cataloge.</p>
